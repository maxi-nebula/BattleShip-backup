After I finish this set I felt like I could do more. So I made another set using the most popular cursors from this set (The 3 black ones) . I created another crosshair set, but the crosshairs now comes with with a colored transparent lens. You can find It here [[cursor-set/crosshair-colored-lens|here]]. Feel free to rate and and tell me what you think in a comment.
